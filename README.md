My project for physics class. 3D game which requires kinematics knowledge. 

#Game Instructions
Move the ball into a target location marked by a cube wireframe
The location of the target will be provided. The ball is at coordinates (0, 0, 0)
The locations of the target(s) will only be shown to you once. Make sure to write them down.
Enter velocity into the provided box and an angle if necessary. If the ball goes into the target box you have succeeded
ANGLES SHOULD BE GIVEN IN RADIANS

##Problem: The GitHub codespaces where I made the game failed to update my repository. Unfortunately, that means that the game can only be played on the codespace preview in Singapore750's account. I'll try to work out a solution to this later
